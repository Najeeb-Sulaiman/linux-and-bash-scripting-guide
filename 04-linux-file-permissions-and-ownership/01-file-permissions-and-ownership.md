## What Does File Permissions Mean?

Every file and directory in Linux has permissions that control:

- Who can access it

- What they can do with it (read, write, execute)


### Types of Users
There are three types of users in Linux. Each file and directory has three levels of permission:

- User (u): The creator/owner of the file.
- Group (g): Users belonging to the file's group.
- Others (o): All other users on the system.
