## Introduction to Bash Scripting

Bash scripting is one of the most powerful tools in a data engineer’s toolkit.
It lets you automate repetitive tasks, manage files, run data pipelines, and glue together tools like Python, Spark, or SQL from the command line. Learning Bash is like learning English, it's very important.

Now,
### What is a Bash Script?

A Bash script is simply a text file that contains a series of Linux commands that execute automatically when run.

Instead of typing each command manually, you can write them once in a script and execute them all at once.

Bash is has a lot of similar concept as other programming languages like Python, so we can somehow say Bash is a programming language.

### Why Use Bash Scripts as a Data Engineer?

Here are some everyday automation scenarios where Bash can be extremely useful:

| Task                  | Description                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Ingestion**    | Automate the download and organization of raw datasets daily.         |
| **Data Cleaning**     | Run commands (like `awk`, `sed`, `grep`) on multiple files.           |
| **ETL Orchestration** | Chain multiple scripts together to extract, transform, and load data. |
| **Environment Setup** | Install dependencies and prepare your local or cloud environment.     |
| **Monitoring Jobs**   | Automate health checks and send alerts on failures.                   |


### Structure of a Bash Script

Every Bash script typically has these parts:

1. Shebang line (defines the interpreter)

2. Commands or logic (what you want to run)
