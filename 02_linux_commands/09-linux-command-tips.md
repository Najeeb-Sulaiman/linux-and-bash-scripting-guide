## Linux Command Tips

Below are some useful tips when working with Linux:


`Whoami` - To know the current user on the terminal

`echo $0` - To know the shell used to run the previous command

We use `/` to separate directory in Linux

Linux is a `case sensitive` OS

`whatis` - A quick way to determine what a command does

Use `up` and `down` arrow to to recall previous commands

Use `TAB` for autocompletion

We use `history` command to see all the commands we have executed lately

We can use `!n` To replay any of the command. E.g !2 to re-run the second command

`sudo !!` - To append sudo to a previous command in case the command requires `sudo`
